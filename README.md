## Introduction

The project is a tutorial for the subject "Social Media Management" on how to use Twitter APIs.
The use and the behaviour of APIs is a part of the program.

Specifically, I have used them to retrieve the tweets of Italian Politicians and make some statistics:
* A table to display all data (it is useful for checking calculations).
* The difference between the number of tweets per day posted by Left-Wing and Right-Wing politicians.
* Weighted statistics by the total number of tweets.
* Weighted statistics by the total number of tweets and the respective number of followers.
