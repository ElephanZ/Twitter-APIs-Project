    "Twitter is a social networking service - launched on July 2006 - on which users post and interact with messages known as 'tweets'. Registered users can post, like, retweet, and comment other users tweets. Unregistered users can just read public tweets. \n",
    "\n",
    "Users can interact with Twitter in two different ways: the user-friendly interface (web or mobile version) or programmatically via its APIs. Twitter is also recognized for having one of the most open developer APIs.<br/>\n",
    "For any additional information you can visit the web page https://developer.twitter.com/en.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main focus of this tutorial is to get italian politicians data and make stats about them.<br/>\n",
    "Probably, Twitter is the best platform to fetch this data because it's the most used by politicians to write about politic. "

    "## Creation of the Developer Profile and Application\n",
    "In order, to use the Twitter APIs, you have to follow some steps:\n",
    "1. If you already have a developer account related to your user account, you can move on to step **4** of the list.<br/>\n",
    "2. You have to create a normal Twitter user profile at [https://twitter.com/](https://twitter.com/).\n",
    "   \n",
    "    <img src=\"https://antonioscardace.altervista.org/smm/signup.png\" alt=\"tutorial image\" style=\"width: 90%; max-width: 500px; margin: 10px 0; border: 1px solid #555\"/>\n",
    "    \n",
    "3. You have to create a developer account related to your user profile. To do this get a look [here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/apply-for-access).\n",
    "   \n",
    "    <img src=\"https://antonioscardace.altervista.org/smm/developer.png\" alt=\"tutorial image\" style=\"width: 550px; margin: 10px 0; border: 1px solid #555\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "4. You need to apply for developer tools. To do that, you will be then asked how will you use Twitter APIs and data. I have selected \"Academic &#8594; Student\".\n",
    "   \n",
    "    <img src=\"https://antonioscardace.altervista.org/smm/student.png\" alt=\"tutorial image\" style=\"width: 900px; margin: 10px 0; border: 1px solid #555\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "5. You will then be asked to confirm your email and your number phone, and to add other personal information (*name, country, current coding skills level*).\n",
    "   \n",
    "    <img src=\"https://antonioscardace.altervista.org/smm/data_confirm.png\" alt=\"tutorial image\" style=\"width: 800px; margin: 10px 0; border: 1px solid #555\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Then, you need to explain how will you use the Twitter APIs and data, and to describe the kind of operations you will do (just retreive tweets, interact with istitutional accounts, post tweets, or something else).\n",
    "   - I suggest to be specific and clear in your answers otherwise they will send you an email with a list of questions to better understand your intents.\n",

    "    \n",
    "8.  After that, to start you will be asked to create your own app (don't worry about the name, you can change it whenever you want) and you will must specify what it will does.\n",
    "9.  You should be able now to see your app in the [list](https://developer.twitter.com/en/portal/dashboard). If you open it, you should find your keys and your tokens (*these values should be kept secret*):\n",

    "## REST APIs\n",
    "Developers can intercat with APIs in two ways (both return a JSON response):\n",
    "\n",
    "- **via some library** \n",
    "  - I have used [python-twitter](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/). It provides a lot of methods which return well-formed objects (User, Tweet, or Geo). For more info about objects structure [see here](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/v1/data-dictionary/object-model/tweet).\n",
    "  - To install it you can read [this guide](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).\n",
    "  - Then you can import the library in your code: ``import twitter``.\n",
    "  - You can initialize an object with your keys and tokens: ``api = twitter.Api(CONSUMER_KEY, CONSUMER_SECRET, ACCESS_TOKEN_KEY, ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET)``.\n",
    "  - And you can use any methods you want. Take a look [here](https://python-twitter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/twitter.html#module-twitter.api). For example, to get user info by his handle: ``user_info = api.GetUser(screen_name=username)``.\n",
    "- **via HTTP requests**\n",
    "  - This method consists in send a GET request to the API URL. You can do this either via a programming language or via the terminal ``curl`` command. For more info, take a look [here for user requests](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/users/lookup/api-reference) and [here for tweet requests](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-api/tweets/timelines/api-reference/get-users-id-tweets#cURL).\n",
    "  - To do that in Python, you need to import the pre-installed library: ``import requests``.\n",
    "  - You need also to make a dictionary ``headers = {'Authorization': \"Bearer \" + BEARER_TOKEN}`` useful to authentication.\n",
    "  - Optionally, if you need to specify parameters, you can create a list or a tuple to set them. For example: ``params = (('start_time', '2021-11-08T12:30:00.000Z'), ('tweet.fields', 'public_metrics,created_at'))``.\n",
    "  - Now you can make a request. For example to get all user tweets by its id: ``response = requests.get(f'https://api.twitter.com/2/users/{user_id}/tweets', headers=headers, params=params)``.\n",
    "  \n",

    "## Conclusion and Future Works\n",
    "To sum up: in my experience Twitter has an excellent APIs system, a great developer portal, and an extensive documentation (documentation, library tools, tutorials, etc.). They provide also an efficient developers community. In my opinion, a great feature of Twitter APIs, is that they are free and allows developers to retreive almost any data - obviously there are a little bit of restrictions available just by premium accounts.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will continue this work as a Machine Learning project to understand if, given an italian politician Twitter profile, he/she belongs to the Left-Wing or the Right-Wing.\n",
    "To do that, I will also create a MySQL database to store my dataset and make more accurate stats. In order to have a big dataset, I will store all tweets every day for almost three months."
